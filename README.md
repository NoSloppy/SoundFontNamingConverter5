### **Version 5: Browser-Based Lightning Speed!**

- **Brand new browser-based converter:**  
  No files are uploaded! Everything is processed instantly in your browser with NO lag, NO waiting on slow servers, and no limits to how many users can run it at once.

- **NEW UI!**  
  Streamlined interface makes getting around and getting your results faster than ever. Output logs are bigger, color-coded, and much easier to read, and downloads are automatically triggered.

- **All your favorite features are here:**
  - **Board-specific renaming:** Handles Proffie, CFX, Golden Harvest, Verso, and Xeno3, including special rules for CFX mixed numbered/unnumbered files, Xeno parenthesis, auto-inclusion of Verso blaster sound, Golden Harvest and Proffie settings files, and more.
  - **Multiple fonts at once:** Process tons of subfolders in one go, and itâ€™s FAST!
  - **Proffie font optimization:** Instantly organizes fonts for best FAT32 SD card performance, automatically applied any time Proffieboard is the target. Includes correctly organizing file structure, wrangling loose files from root, etc...
  - **Auto-Audio Conversion:** Renaming automatically converts mis-formatted WAVs, converts MP3's, and strips metadata from audio files. Sweet!
  - **Audio-only conversion:** Converts WAV and MP3 files to 44.1kHz, 16-bit mono (no renaming, just pure conversion for soundboard compatibility).
  - **High-pass filtering option:** Make sure your fonts sound clean on small saber speakers.
  - **Conversion logs provided with every conversion:** Keep a clear record of everything that happened, included in your download.

- **Bonus:** Quick links to the best saber sites, right in the footer.
